# Node.js Server Exploration

This project is designed to explore and understand fundamental server-side concepts in Node.js, focusing on how certain functionalities work under the hood. The project is primarily backend-focused and includes features such as middlewares, streams, and local file storage.

## Features

- Middleware implementation
- Stream handling for efficient data processing
- User management (CRUD operations):
  - List all users
  - Create a new user
  - Edit an existing user
  - Remove a user
- Data persistence using local file storage
